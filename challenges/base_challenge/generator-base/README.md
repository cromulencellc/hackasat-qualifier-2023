This is a base image, essentially it wraps a set of functionality to be 
used by all generators. It has a folder called /upload with at least a upload.sh
script inside of it. Generators are responsible to include the following:

    COPY --from=generator-base /upload /upload

and as part of their Docker entrypoint/command they must pipe a list of files
(one per line) to /upload/upload.sh, which will handle the rest. An example:

    CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "python generate.py | /upload/upload.sh"]

It is recommended that the list of files are absolute paths.

It is currently in a debug configuration, upload.sh will echo each file to 
it's stdout (for debugging) and will copy each file to an /out directory. 
To use this when making a generator in challenge dev, you can mount a local 
directory to /out as follows:
    
    docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`/out:/out sample-challenge:generator
