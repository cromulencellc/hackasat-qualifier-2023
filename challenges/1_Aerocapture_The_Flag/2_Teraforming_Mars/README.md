The Galactic Mining and Tunneling Corporation (GMAT) is back in action. This time we've extended our operations to include a terraforming base on the planet Mars. We have a communication satellite inbound but our orbit mechanics guy went on vacation and won't answer his phone or email, how inconsiderate. Calculate the maneuvers to keep the satellite in contact with the terraforming base and we will reward you with a flag.
