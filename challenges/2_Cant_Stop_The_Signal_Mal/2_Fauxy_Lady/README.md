A university needs your help collecting their cubesat's telemetry. We've captured a .wav recording of the satellite signal and the university has published the telemetry definition. The recorded signal has the following characteristics:
 * BPSK modulated
 * Differentially encoded
 * 44.1k samples per second
 
Can you reconstruct the telemetry packet?

Maybe give this info to teams: the wav file sample rate is 44.1k, BPSK modulated, and differentially encoded.
