## Notes

A cipher challenge for teams to decipher a set of messages that were encrypted using the WW2 Japanese Naval code (JN-25).

Clone: clone from the challenge from the 'MeetMeAtMidway' HAS4 quals repo.

To build:

- $ make (build both challenge and solver)
- $ make challenge (builds and run challenge)
- $ make challenge_run (run challege)
- $ make solver (builds solver)
- $ make test (runs both to test solver)

NOTE: **the solver takes around 20 seconds to run on my laptop, your mileage may vary**
