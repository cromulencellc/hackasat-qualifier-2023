As Below: Decompile with wasm2c then solve for key using z3 
Leavenworth Street: Docker forensics to extract binary, reverse engineer the crystal challenge binary and then write a flood-fill maze solver 
Hyde Street: Docker forensics to extract service then read source files to make keygen 
So above: Docker forensics to extract service, automated binary reversing with the given js libraries and then use disassmebly to make a keygen
