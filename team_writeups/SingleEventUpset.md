For Based Emoji, we first set up a script to get the factors of each emoji. It merely queried the server with a Block 1 emoji, recording all results in a dictionary. There were several different rules we used to determine what an encoding was, such as: (1) A number with only two factors must be prime; (2) A number with an odd number of factors must be a perfect square. Then we started to utilize another of the challenge’s commands to get random factors of numbers that were 6 bits long. We would let it run for several iterations then stop and look at the results. We would look for rows that contained one, and only one, of the remaining emojis. Using the same rules as above, we were usually able to determine what the missing emoji’s value had to have been. We did this for a few minutes until we were able to complete our emoji-to-bit mapping. Next we wrote a simple function to convert a string of emojis into a number and then we were able to decrypt the flag.
