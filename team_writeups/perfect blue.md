The challenge Leavenworth Street provided a container which seems to be a judger for a competitive programming style problem writing in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), expecting a Deno program at /solver/solver.ts. We were too lazy to reverse the judger to find out what problem it checks, we simply asked ChatGPT to generate a Deno code that dumps stdin to stderr. The testcase looks like a maze prefixed with the maze maps' byte length. We then pasted the first testcase to ChatGPT and asked it to write a solver, with the path written in "UDLR" (up down left right). That doesn't work, so we asked ChatGPT to change it to "NWES" and it worked.
