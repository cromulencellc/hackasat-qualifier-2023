Doing some initial RE work, our team was able to get a Python script talking to the server. Dumping the configuration using the B1 command, miek realized that the B2 command was susceptible to a stack overflow, reading up to 300 bytes into a 100 byte buffer. Shortly after, we had a script to exploit the overflow, jumping back into a puts call as a PoC. A while later, I began doing research on writing ROP chains for RISC-V and was able to find a pair of gadgets that let me chain calls to any number of functions taking up to 3 parameters (3fde2 -> 3fe1c). I used this to call open, read, and write to retrieve the flag from "flag.txt" (assuming open() would return file descriptor 3) and send it back on stdout (file descriptor 1).
