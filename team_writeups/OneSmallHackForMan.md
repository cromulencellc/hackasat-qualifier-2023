Dashing: Started from the beepboop.wav which was 16-bit Mono, 44100HZ sampled WAVE audio. Simply playing it back it sounded like static. We used Sonic Visualiser and Audacity to better understand what we're looking at. Plotting the Spectrum we noticed a peak at 196 Hz. So we also looked at the spectrogram and it was Morse. Now we understand the name of the challenge as Morse is Dashes and Dots. We first decoded the first 10 characters manually to see what kind of data we're looking at. It was the flag, hex-encoded. So then we played with Notch filters and adjusting the tempo such that using open-source Morse decoders would read the first 10 characters as we did. In the end we got the full hex-encoded flag, decoded it and sent it to the scoreboard platform.
