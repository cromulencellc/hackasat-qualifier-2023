RISC-V Smash Baby: A stack buffer overflow in a RISCV binary hosted in QEMU, as one of the functions reads 60 bytes into a 20 byte buffer. Since the stack is executable and the flag is still in memory, overwrite the return address with a stack address to shellcode calling puts(flag_addr). The challenge tried to remove the flag from the environment using unsetenv("FLAG"), but the data stays in memory and can still be read out using the provided direct pointer.
