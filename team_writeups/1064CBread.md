For signals from trisolaris, we first took the FFT of an antenna's data to discover there are 5 signals. We then calculate the average phase difference for those signals for two elements in the X, or Y direction. We can then solve a system of equations to create a vector which points at the DOA of each signal. Taking those direction vectors and mapping them onto the specified location using skyfield, we were able to locate the five stars that these vectors pointed to (using a 1 degree search space).
