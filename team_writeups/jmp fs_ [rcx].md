Leavenworth street is a challenge that revolves around writing code that will execute on a remote system (such as a satellite) to accomplish a task -- in this case, that task is solving mazes. The challenge system accepts a Typescript solver that will be fed a text-based representation of a maze, with # defining walls, S defining the start, and F defining the finish. By parsing the maze into a two-dimensional array, it is possible to use a depth-first search algorithm to quickly create a path through the maze (given sufficiently small mazes). To return the solution to the challenge server, the script must console.log the path utilizing a single string composed of NEWS characters (cardinal directions). Once the solver has solved enough, successively larger mazes, the flag is output.
